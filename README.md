# Dotfiles
User configuration files for my Linux system. Designed to be managed with GNU Stow. Contains config files for the following packages:

- Hyprland (and associated Hypr Ecosystem apps)
- zsh
- fastfetch (modified from [druxorey's dotfiles](https://github.com/druxorey/dotfiles))
- more to come...

## Todo
- Add additional dotfiles
- Script automated installation of package dependencies and config file deployment
